            "overview": "<p>Oversee.net operates a performance marketing traffic network that connects advertisers with pre-qualified users.</p><p>In 2002, it’s DomainSponsor business unit pioneered the “domain parking” technology that allows owners of undeveloped domain names to monetize the organic, direct navigation traffic hitting those domains.  Users win by connecting quickly to highly relevant advertisers.  Advertisers win by receiving pre-qualified, high converting, motivated traffic.  And owners of undeveloped domains win by earning revenue on organic traffic.  Today, DomainSponsor’s traffic network receives nearly 1 billion visits per month from around the world.  </p><p>In early 2011, DomainSponsor announced a new service that allows advertisers to directly bid on and acquire targeted segments of  the direct navigation traffic on its network.  Since direct navigation users have very specific, strong intent, research studies have shown that they have favorable conversion rates for advertisers.  </p><p>Oversee.net also produces over 14 million pre-qualified leads per month for advertisers on its owned and operated lead generation websites in the travel, consumer finance, and shopping verticals.  Sites include LowFares.com, FareSpotter.net, AirportParking.com, AboutAirportParking.com, CreditCards.org, BadCreditOffers.com, ShopWiki.com and CouponFinder.com.</p><p>Oversee.net also owns nearly 1 million undeveloped domain names that contribute organic, direct navigation traffic to its performance marketing traffic network.</p><p>Its head office is located in Los Angeles, with additional offices located in New York City and Frankfurt, Germany.</p>",
